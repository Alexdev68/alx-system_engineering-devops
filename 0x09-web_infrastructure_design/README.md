# Web infrastructure design
Web and infrastructure design refer to the process of creating the architecture and layout of a website or web application, as well as planning and setting up the necessary infrastructure to support its functionality and performance.

## Application server vs web server
An application server is responsible for executing the business logic and processing dynamic content of a web application. It interacts with databases, other services, and external systems to generate dynamic content and deliver it to the web server or directly to the client. While a web server is responsible for handling HTTP requests from clients (typically web browsers) and delivering the requested web resources, such as HTML pages, images, CSS files, and JavaScript files. It primarily deals with static content and acts as an intermediary between the client and the web application.

In summary, the web server deals with static content and serves as a front-end that handles client requests and static files, while the application server handles dynamic content, executes server-side scripts, and interacts with databases and other systems to generate dynamic responses for web applications. In many cases, web servers and application servers work together in a web infrastructure to deliver complete web applications to users.
